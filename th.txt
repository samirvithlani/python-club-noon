programming langugae :-
    void main()

scripting langugae :-
    print("hello world")


print("hello")
compiler:- compiler will compile code in small chunks and then it will execute the code

interpreter : line by line execution
python is interpreter language

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

staticly typed language :-
    you need to define the type of variable before using it
    c++ is staticly typed language
    java is staticly typed language
    c is staticly typed language
dynamicly typed language :-
    you dont need to define the type of variable before using it
    python is dynamicly typed language


defination variable: variable  is container which can hold value..

1) variable name should be unique
2) variable name should not start with number
3) variable name should not contain any special character except underscore(_)
4) variable name should not be any keyword
5) variable name should not contain any space

int x =100

#opearotes:
opearotes are used to perform some operation on operands

type of operators:-
1) arithmatic operators +,-,*,/,%,//,**

2) assignment operators =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=,//=,**=
3) comparision operators ==,!=,>,<,>=,<=
    descision making statements
    if else
    loops

    true --> output
    false --> output

4) logical operators and,or,not
5) bitwise operators &,|,^,~,<<,>>
6) identity operators is,is not
7) membership operators in,not in


String : char array

unicode : 2 byte
A : 65
Z : 90

a : 97
z : 122

space : 32


functions:- function is a block of code which can be used again and again

use : code reusability,code optimization,code readability,code maintainability

type: pre defined function
      user defined function

1) with return type and with argument
2) with return type and without argument
3) without return type and with argument
4) without return type and without argument        

Exception handling....
Error:
Exception: 
def: Exception is a process that stop the execution of program

try except finally
raise

oops with python:
encapsulation:
    class
    object
    constructor
abstraction

inheritance:

polymorphism: many forms
    overloading : same function name with different parameters
    overriding : same function name with same parameters from parent class to child class

class : class is group of data member and member function,class is blue print of object

object :object is instance / entity / identity  of class

class   object
Resume   user

Vehcile  car
Fruit    Mango
School   student

howmany copies will generate for insrance variable in python???

polymorphism : run time
                method overloading
               compile time
                method overloading


method overloading ??
same name of method but args / parem data should be change....

string
search(pname)
string string
search(pname,pcolr)
string int
sarch(pname,pprice)


runtime polymorphism : method overriding
same function in side child class which is already present in parent class


class Iphone{

    display()
}

class iphone13 extends Iphone{

    display(){}
}
class iphone13 extends Iphone{

    display(){}
}
